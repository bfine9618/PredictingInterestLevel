The initial dataset can be found in ./rawData. I have also used the script 'clean data' to standardize columns, rows and names to use for the rest of the analysis. Finally, using the NLP script, i was successful in determining the type of rental from 75% of the data. After running a basic OLS regression with typed data, we are able to predict with higher accuracy what the interest level in each home is.
